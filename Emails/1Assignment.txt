Hello,

You will find attached to this email Assignment 1, which focuses on probability. This may be required to complete some of the problems. Assignment 1 is due on: Wednesday, January 31, at the beginning of lecture. In attempting problems, keep in mind that most of the learning is in the trying, and a large part of assignment grading is based on participation. Also, you are encouraged to work in groups, yet you need to submit your own solution.

You will also find attached to this message a set of guidelines for solutions to assignments. Please, read through this document carefully and follow the guidelines when creating solutions. This PDF document is available on the class Google Drive repository under Miscellaneous.

Best regards,
Jean-Francois Chamberland
