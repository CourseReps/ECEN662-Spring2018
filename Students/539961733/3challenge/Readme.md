Challenge 2

In this challenge, we need to estimate the success probility theta of Beta-binomial model. As the proof of the figure, we can get a conclusion that the best estimate of theta is the success times over whole times. I averaged eight data in every sample to get the average success times. And then, I get the ThetaHead to eastimate theta. Finally, I calculated MSE by using TrainingData.
