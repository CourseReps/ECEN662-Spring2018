# Challenge 1: Binary Detection

Last semester I took a course about pattern recognition. So when I saw this problem, my first thought was using the classification knowledge I learned last semester to handle this challenge. So, at first, I tried several classification algorithm including SVM, KNN and LDA. The error rates for them are 35.3% for SVM, 20.4% for 3NN and 40% for LDA. From the plot I can see that this is a very tough classification problem since the two kinds of samples have a lot of overlapping part. So I think 20% error rate is a good result. Then I started to think about the knowledge in this class. And this case looks exactly like Gaussian. however, these two classes obviously have different convariance. Therefore, the idea of using LDA is wrong and this can explain the high error rate when using LDA. So I tried QDA for this task, and the error is 35%. I think this is because two classes are so similar in mean and the overlapping part is so large, even if we find the optimal model for Gaussian, it still has a very high error rate. As a result, 3NN is my Bayesian classifier for this problem,.
